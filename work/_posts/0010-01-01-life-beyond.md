Chris Baker got in touch with a brief to create branding for a personal podcast, *Life Beyond*. The podcast was to cover three media fields: radio, television, and voice-over, with a particular focus on those who made it a career.

<figure class="image-block">
  <div class="image-block__content">
    {% include utilities/work-image.html filename="early-concepts.jpg" height="1202" alt="" %}
    {% include utilities/work-image.html filename="winning-idea.jpg" height="1202" alt="" column="half" %}
    {% include utilities/work-image.html filename="expanding-the-idea.jpg" height="1202" alt="" column="half" %}
  </div>
</figure>

My concept was to make use of symbols showcasing the media fields in the logo. This gave me the opportunity to work on icons that are widely used, but had to be unique to the brand AND be a clear indication of the real-life item. With some experimentation, Chris and I were very happy with the end result.

  <div class="image-block__content">
    {% include utilities/work-image.html filename="icon-design.png" height="640" alt="" %}
  </div>
  {% include utilities/image-caption.html caption="Icon concepts, experimenting with different line weights and levels of detail" %}
</figure>
