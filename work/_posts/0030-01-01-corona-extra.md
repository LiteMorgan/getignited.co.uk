Part of a brief to develop the UK identity for *Corona*, and introduce the brand lifestyle - ‘La Vida Corona’. Users where given the chance to submit their ideas for a bucket list of experiences that had to be seen.

To inspire users, a gallery of featured moments was added. This provided some interactivity, to both discover more about the moment, and why it was bucket list worthy.
