{% capture pageslug %}{{ page.slug }}{% endcapture %}

I've spent many an hour immersed in the world of <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>, so when my Free Company (think 'guild') wanted to get a logo made up, I jumped at the chance.

My aim with the logo was to make use of mixed fonts. Ideally a serif and sans-serif, but in places using mixed weights. The word 'gravity' had to feel heavier, given the definition of it, and thus that tended to use the bigger font weight, or alternatively a slab serif.

To incorporate the fantasty aspect of the game, I made use of Eorzean-type fonts, based on the game's primary written language, and expertly recreated by [dachoutom](http://dachoutom.org/ffxiv/fonts.html).

{% assign images = page.images[0] %}
{% include utilities/image.html %}

The final design was chosen by user vote on the group's private forums, and from there made available to be implemented into member Twitch streams.

{% assign images = page.images[1] %}
{% include utilities/image.html %}

{% assign images = page.images[2] %}
