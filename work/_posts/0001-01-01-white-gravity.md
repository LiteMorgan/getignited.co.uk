I've spent many an hour immersed in the world of <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>, so when my Free Company (think 'guild') wanted to get a logo made up, I jumped at the chance.

My aim with the logo was to make use of mixed fonts. Ideally a serif and sans-serif, but in places using mixed weights. The word 'gravity' had to feel heavier, given the definition of it, and thus that tended to use the bigger font weight, or alternatively a slab serif.

To incorporate the fantasty aspect of the game, I made use of Eorzean-type fonts, based on the game's primary written language, and expertly recreated by [dachoutom](http://dachoutom.org/ffxiv/fonts.html).

    {% include utilities/work-image.html filename="logo-concept-2.png" width="620" height="620" alt="" column="third" %}
    {% include utilities/work-image.html filename="logo-concept-3.png" width="620" height="620" alt="" column="third" %}
    {% include utilities/work-image.html filename="logo-concept-4.png" width="620" height="620" alt="" column="third" %}
    {% include utilities/work-image.html filename="logo-concept-5.png" width="620" height="620" alt="" column="third" %}
    {% include utilities/work-image.html filename="logo-concept-6.png" width="620" height="620" alt="" column="third" %}
    {% include utilities/work-image.html filename="logo-concept-7.png" width="620" height="620" alt="" column="third" %}
    {% include utilities/work-image.html filename="logo-concept-8.png" width="620" height="620" alt="" column="third" %}
    {% include utilities/work-image.html filename="logo-concept-9.png" width="620" height="620" alt="" column="third" %}
  </div>
  {% include utilities/image-caption.html caption="Logo concepts and explorations" %}
</figure>

The final design was chosen by user vote on the group's private forums, and from there made available to be implemented into member Twitch streams.
