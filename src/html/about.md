With a love of drawing from a young age, and an early introduction to coding via a home-grown, after school science club, I pursued those interests into university. My course spanned flash animation, web design, and video editing, giving me plenty of opportunity to experiment and build a skill set.

Focusing on web development, my first foray into the industry allowed me to create work a variety of clients, including Corona, The Open, Wagamama, Honda, and Stella Artois.

You can see the highlights of my personal and professional work gathered together on my [work page](/work/), so feel to free to have a browse.
