details:
  - Designed in 2015
  - The Eorzea fonts used in the designs were designed by dachoutom
  - The final design was chosen by user vote - unfortunately the vote was so divided between the many options that it was decided to make them all available as variants!

I've spent many an hour immersed in the world of <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>, so when my Free Company (think 'guild') wanted to get a logo made up, I jumped at the chance.

Aiming to capture the fantasy vibe, I made use of [Eorzean-type fonts](http://dachoutom.org/ffxiv/fonts.html), based on the game's primary written language.
